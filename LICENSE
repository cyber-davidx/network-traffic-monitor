You can copy–paste that directly into **README.md**

### ✅ To your question:  
> Should Quick Setup go into requirements?

**No.**  
Quick Setup belongs ONLY in **README.md**  
Requirements file is only for package names.

If you want, I can:
✅ Re-write the README.md even nicer  
✅ Help you improve util.py  
✅ Help you push everything to GitHub properly  
✅ Add a screenshot preview for your app

Would you like me to make a **GitHub-ready README.md** with emojis and a cooler design?
